	Web design: How did you design the website? What principles (working methodology) did you work according to? 
How did you implement the solutions? 
================================================================================================
For this website, we implemented Scrum methodology to design and implement. The Scrum schedule contains 2 main Sprints: raw-design sprint and polished-design sprint. In the first sprint, we aim to design all the necessary elements, intuitive navigation, clear content, and responsive layout. We pair programmed the first sprint so that our group can get all the connected pages together quickly. After we have achieved necessary components for our website, we aim to polish the website presentation with images related to the website’s theme. We also ensure that the colour codes are cohesive between pages and adequate colour contrast is applied in each page. 

Technology used for implementation: e.g., JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5
